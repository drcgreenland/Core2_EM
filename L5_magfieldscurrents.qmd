# The Biot-Savart Law

*Recommended reading*: Griffiths Section 5.2

## Pre-lecture problem 

Find the magnitude of the attractive force between two long, parallel wires which are a distance $d$ apart, carrying currents $I_1$ and $I_2$. 

We saw in the last lecture that a  current-carrying wire experiences a magnetic force when in the prescence of an applied magnetic field, and we found an expression for the magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire. Ultimately, current-carrying wires experience this force because they produce their own magnetic field which interacts with the applied magnetic field. The Biot-Savart Law is a formula for the magnetic field of a steady line current. Note that we are once again thinking about *line* currents, so we are modelling our currents as 1-dimensional.  

**An aside on steady currents:**
The Biot-Savart Law only applies to so-called "steady currents". A steady current is defined as a continuous flow of charge that goes on forever, without changing and without charge piling up anywhere. In reality, there is no such current, but for the purposes of this course we can model current-carrying wires as carrying steady currents. If the current wasn't a steady current, the magnetic field produced by the current would be varying as a function of time, and we would no longer be in the realm of magnetostatics, which deals in static (non-time varying) magnetic fields. 

The Biot-Savart Law takes the following form:

$$\B(\r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int \frac{\I \times \hat{\r_s} }{\r_s^2} \mathrm{d}l' =  \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int I \frac{\mathrm{d} \l' \times \hat{\r_s} }{\r_s^2} $$

In your previous studies you may have come across the formula for the magnetic field at a distance from a current-carrying wire. Have you ever wondered where this equation came from? Turns out it is derived using the Biot-Savart Law - I'm going to guide you the derivation here, to demonstrate how we use the Biot-Savart Law. 

## Magnetic Field of a Current-Carrying Wire

Our task here is to find the magnetic field at a distance $s$ from a long, straight wire carrying a steady current $I$. 

**Important:** When we talk about a "long" wire, we are talking about a wire that is so long that it can be considered infinitely long - so that we can assume it carries a steady current (see "aside on steady currents" above). In real life, wires that carry currrent are usually part of a closed circuit, so we can consider most current-carrying wires to be carrying steady currents, as the current in closed circuit will go on forever (until a switch is opened, a battery dies, a component breaks, and so on...). 

Let us first visualise the problem with a diagram: 
![](Figures/BS-example-1.png){width=200}{#BS-ex1}

This figure is taken from the Griffiths, therefore the curly "r" pointing from $\mathrm{d} \l'$ to $P$ should be interpreted as $\r_s$ in our notation. As a reminder, the Biot-Savart Law is given by

$$\B(\r) =  \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int I \frac{\mathrm{d} \l' \times \hat{\r_s} }{\r_s^2} $$

In @BS-ex1,  $\mathrm{d} \l' \times \hat{\r_s}$ points out of the page (because it must be perpendicular to both vectors) and has magnitude $\mathrm{d} l' \sin\alpha$. However, it is more convenient in this problem for us to to work with the angle $\theta$, because we can use trigonometric identities to relate $\theta$ more easily to the other variables in our problem. Therefore we can use the angle addition formula $\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$, to find
$$ \sin\alpha = \sin(90 + \theta) = \sin(90)\cos\theta + \cos(90)\sin\theta = \cos\theta $$

Hence, the magnitude of $\mathrm{d} \l' \times \hat{\r_s}$ is

$$ \mathrm{d} l' \cos\theta $$ 

We can also say that $l' = s \tan\theta$, therefore

$$ \begin{split} 
\frac{\mathrm{d} l'}{\mathrm{d} \theta} &=  \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} \theta} s \tan\theta \\
\dd l' &=  \frac{s}{ \cos^2 \theta} \dd \theta
\end{split}
$$ 

Finally, we can see that $s = r_s \cos \theta$, so we can state

$$ \frac{1}{\r_s^2} = \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{s^2} $$

We now have everything we need to compute the integral in the Biot-Savart Law. We  can integrate with respect to $\theta$, and find the integral between two angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, as represented in this figure:

![](Figures/BS-example-2.png){width=200}

Therefore

$$ \begin{split} 
B &= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \left( frac{\cos^2 \theta }{s^2} \right) \left( \frac{s}{\cos^\theta} \right) \cos\theta \dd \theta   \\
 &= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi s} \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}  \cos\theta \dd \theta \\
 &= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi s} (\sin\theta_2 - \sin \theta_1) 
\end{split}
$$ 

The above equations represents the $B$-field at a distance $s$ from a short section of wire between two arbitrary anglular positions $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. This is not physical however, because a short section of wire cannot carry a steady current. Therefore let's think about what happens when we extend the length of the wire to infinity. For an infinitely long wire, $\theta_1 = -\pi/2$ and $\theta_2 = \pi/2$. Hence,  the magnitude of the $B$-field at a distance $s$ from a long current-carrying wire is 

$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi s}. $$#eq-Bwire
