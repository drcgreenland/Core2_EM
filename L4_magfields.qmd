## Post-lecture problem 

In the lecture we sketched the trajectory of the particle in Example 5.2 at a starting velocity of $(E/B) \hat{\y}$. We found that the particle travels in a straight line at a constant speed. 

**Q:** Find and sketch the trajectory of the particle in Example 5.2, if it starts at the origin with velocity:
(a) $(E/2B) \hat{\y}$
(b) $(E/B) (\hat{\y} + \hat{\z}$)
