## Introduction to Electric Potential

Electric potential is a scalar quantity associated with the electric field. It is defined as the potential energy per unit charge at a particular point in space (for example, at the location of a test charge $Q$). The concept of electric potential simplifies many calculations in electrostatics, particularly when dealing with electric fields and potential energy.

## Definition of Electric Potential

The electric potential $V$, at a particular point in space, is defined as the work $W$ done by an external force to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to that point without any acceleration: 

$$ V(r)=−\int_\infty^r \E \cdot \mathrm{d}\l $$ 


where $\E$ is the electric field, $\mathrm{d}\l$  is an infinitesimal displacement vector along the path of the charge.

3. Potential Difference
The potential difference VABV_{AB}VAB between two points AAA and BBB is given by: 

$$ V_{AB} = V(A) − V(B) = -\int_{B}^{A} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l $$

This quantity represents the work done per unit charge by the electric field in moving a charge from point B to point A.

## Electric Potential Due to a Point Charge
For a point charge $q$ located at the origin, the electric potential at a distance $r$ is: 
$$ V(r) = k_e \frac{q}{r} $$ 
where $k_e$ is Coulomb's constant ($k_e \approx 8.99×109 \times 10^9$ =Nm$^2$ / C$^2$).

5. Electric Potential Due to Multiple Point Charges
The principle of superposition applies to electric potential, just as it does to electric fields. For multiple point charges qiq_iqi located at positions ri\mathbf{r}_iri, the total potential at a point r\mathbf{r}r is the sum of the potentials due to each charge: V(r)=ke∑iqi∣r−ri∣V(\mathbf{r}) = k_e \sum_{i} \frac{q_i}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|}V(r)=ke∑i∣r−ri∣qi

6. Relationship Between Electric Field and Potential
The electric field is related to the electric potential by the gradient: E=−∇V\mathbf{E} = -\nabla VE=−∇V This relationship implies that the electric field points in the direction of the greatest decrease of potential.

7. Equipotential Surfaces
Equipotential surfaces are surfaces on which the electric potential is constant. Key properties include:
•	No work is required to move a charge along an equipotential surface.
•	Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.

8. Calculating Electric Potential
Example 1: Uniform Electric Field For a uniform electric field E=E0x^\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{\mathbf{x}}E=E0x^, the potential difference between two points along the x-axis is: V(x)=−E0x+V0V(x) = -E_0 x + V_0V(x)=−E0x+V0 where V0V_0V0 is the potential at x=0x = 0x=0.
Example 2: Potential Due to a Continuous Charge Distribution For a continuous charge distribution with volume charge density ρ(r′)\rho(\mathbf{r'})ρ(r′), the electric potential at a point r\mathbf{r}r is: V(r)=ke∫ρ(r′)∣r−r′∣d3r′V(\mathbf{r}) = k_e \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} d^3\mathbf{r'}V(r)=ke∫∣r−r′∣ρ(r′)d3r′

9. Potential of a Charged Sphere
Example: Solid Sphere For a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius RRR and total charge QQQ:
•	Inside the sphere (r < R): V(r)=keQ2R(3−r2R2)V(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{2R} \left( 3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)V(r)=ke2RQ(3−R2r2)
•	Outside the sphere (r > R): V(r)=keQrV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{r}V(r)=kerQ
Example: Thin Spherical Shell For a thin spherical shell of radius RRR and total charge QQQ:
•	Inside the shell (r < R): V(r)=keQRV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{R}V(r)=keRQ
•	Outside the shell (r > R): V(r)=keQrV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{r}V(r)=kerQ



13. Summary
Electric potential is a crucial concept in electrostatics, simplifying the analysis of electric fields and the work done by (or on) charges. It is ~intimately related~?? to the electric field and provides a scalar measure of potential energy per unit charge. Understanding electric potential is essential for solving a wide range of problems in electrostatics.
