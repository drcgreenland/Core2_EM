## Introduction to electric potential


Electric potential is a scalar quantity associated with the electric field. It is defined as the potential energy per unit charge at a particular point in space (for example, at the location of a test charge $Q$). The concept of electric potential simplifies many calculations in electrostatics, particularly when dealing with electric fields and potential energy.

## Definition of Electric Potential

The electric potential $V$, at a particular point in space, is defined as the work $W$ done by an external force to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to that point without any acceleration: 

$$ V(r)=−\int_\infty^r \E \cdot \mathrm{d}\l $$ 


where $\E$ is the electric field, $\mathrm{d}\l$  is an infinitesimal displacement vector along the path of the charge.

## Potential Difference
The potential difference V_{AB} between two points AAA and BBB is given by: 

$$ V_{AB} = V(A) − V(B) = -\int_{B}^{A} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l $$

This quantity represents the work done per unit charge by the electric field in moving a charge from point B to point A.

## Electric Potential Due to a Point Charge
For a point charge $q$ located at the origin, the electric potential at a distance $r$ is: 
$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} $$ 

where $$\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space as defined in Section [?].

## Electric Potential Due to Multiple Point Charges
The principle of superposition applies to electric potential, just as it does to electric fields and forces. For multiple point charges $q_i$ located at positions $\r_i$, the total potential at a point \r is the sum of the potentials due to each charge: 

$$ V(r) = k_e \sum_{i} \frac{q_i}{|\r - \r_i|} $$

## Relationship Between Electric Field and Potential (Poisson's and Laplace's equation)

The electric field is related to the electric potential by the gradient: $\E = -\nabla V$. This relationship implies that the electric field points in the direction of the greatest decrease of potential.

## Potential of a continuous charge distribution

## Equipotential Surfaces
Equipotential surfaces are surfaces on which the electric potential is constant. Key properties include:
•	No work is required to move a charge along an equipotential surface.
•	Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.

## Example 1: Potential of a uniformly charged sphere

For a continuous charge distribution with volume charge density $\rho(\r')$, the electric potential at a point r\mathbf{r}r is: V(r)=ke∫ρ(r′)∣r−r′∣d3r′V(\mathbf{r}) = k_e \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} d^3\mathbf{r'}V(r)=ke∫∣r−r′∣ρ(r′)d3r′

For a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius RRR and total charge QQQ:
•	Inside the sphere (r < R): V(r)=keQ2R(3−r2R2)V(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{2R} \left( 3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)V(r)=ke2RQ(3−R2r2)
•	Outside the sphere (r > R): V(r)=keQrV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{r}V(r)=kerQ
Example: Thin Spherical Shell For a thin spherical shell of radius RRR and total charge QQQ:
•	Inside the shell (r < R): V(r)=keQRV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{R}V(r)=keRQ
•	Outside the shell (r > R): V(r)=keQrV(r) = k_e \frac{Q}{r}V(r)=kerQ

## Summary
Electric potential is a crucial concept in electrostatics, simplifying the analysis of electric fields and the work done by (or on) charges. It is ~intimately related~?? to the electric field and provides a scalar measure of potential energy per unit charge. Understanding electric potential is essential for solving a wide range of problems in electrostatics.
