# Electric Potential

*Recommended reading*: Griffiths Section 2.3

## Pre-lecture problem

Before you attempt this problem, it is recommended that you read through the lecture notes, as well as Sections 2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Griffiths. This question also requires some vector calculus, to which you have only just been introduced. Do not worry if you can't do this question just yet - we will go through it in the lecture. 

One of these is an impossible electrostatic field. Which one?

(a) $\E = k[ xy \hat{\x} + 2yz \hat{\y} + 3xz \hat{\z} ]$

(b) $\E = k[ y^2 \hat{\x} + (2xy + z^2)\hat{\y} + 2yz \hat{\z} ]$

For the *possible* one, find the potential. Use the origin as your reference point. 
Check your answer by computing $\nabla V$.

[:bulb: **Hint:** you must select a specific path to integrate along. The answer is **path-independent**, meaning that you will get the same answer no matter what path you choose--however, it is simply not possible to integrate unless you have a particular path in mind.]



## Introduction to electric potential

Electric potential is a scalar quantity associated with the electric field. It is defined as the work done by an external force to bring a unit positive charge to a particular point in space (for example, the location of a test charge $Q$) from an arbitrary reference point.
For the purposes of this lecture course, we will choose infinity ($\infty$) as our reference point - but please note that Griffiths does not use infinity but rather uses the symbol $\mathcal{O}$ to denote an arbitrary reference point.  

We will see later how the concept of electric potential simplifies many calculations in electrostatics, particularly when dealing with electric fields and potential energy.

## Definition of Electric Potential

The electric potential $V$ at some displacement $\r$ is given by

$$ V(\r) = −\int_{\infty}^r \E \cdot \mathrm{d}\l $$ 


where $\E$ is the electric field, and $\mathrm{d}\l$  is an infinitesimal displacement vector along the path of the charge. As we have stated, the potential is the work done per unit charge, therefore we can see how the above can be derived. The work done by a force to bring an object from infinity to point $\r$ is given by $ \int_\infty^r \F \cdot \mathrm{d}\l$, therefore the work done per unit charge is $\int_\infty^r \frac{\F}{Q} \cdot \mathrm{d}\l = \int_\infty^r \E \cdot \mathrm{d}\l$. However, you will notice that the expression shown above is $- \int_\infty^r \E \cdot \mathrm{d}\l$ - by convention, we add a minus sign because the direction of the electric field is the direction of *decreasing* potential. Let me explain this. We have seen in the previous lecture that electric field lines point away from a positive charge. If we place a positive test charge in the vicinity of another positive charge, the test charge will move away, in the direction of the electric field. This is the direction of decreasing potential because the charge loses potential energy as it moves away. Hence, the electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential, so the expression for potential must be the negative of the electric field. 

## Potential Difference

The potential difference $V_{ab}$ between two points $\a$ and $\b$ is given by: 

$$
\begin{split} 
V_{ab} & = V(\b) − V(\a) \\
& = -\int_{\infty}^{\b} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l + \int_{\infty}^{\a} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l \\
& = -\int_{\infty}^{\b} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l - \int_{\a}^{\infty} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l \\
& = -\int_{\a}^{\b} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l 
\end{split}
$$


$$ V_{ab} = V(\b) − V(\a) = -\int_{\a}^{\b} \E \cdot \mathrm{d} \l $$

This quantity represents the work done per unit charge by the electric field in moving a charge from point $\a$ to point $\b$. 

## Electric Potential Due to a Point Charge

For a point charge $q$ located at the origin, the electric potential at a displacement $\r$ can be found by computing the potential difference between infinity and the point $\r$ - this is derived in Section 2.3.4 of the Griffiths and comes out as follows: 

<!--
that is, the work done per unit charge in bringing a test charge from infinity to point $\r$. Try using the expression for $V_{ab}$ above to do this - you can use $\mathrm{d}\r$ as the displacement vector $\mathrm{d}\l$. You should find that the potential due to a point charge is:-->


$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} $$ 

If the point charge is not at the origin, we can generalise the above equation to:

$$ V(\r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r_s} $$ 

where $r_s$ is the separation between $q$ and $\r$, with $\r$ being the displacement with respect to the origin. 

## Electric Potential Due to Multiple Point Charges

The principle of superposition applies to electric potential, just as it does to electric fields and forces. For multiple point charges $q_i$ located at positions $\r_i$, the total potential at a point \r is the sum of the potentials due to each charge: 

$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i} \frac{q_i}{\r_{s_i}} $$ {#eq-Vmulti}

## Electric Potential Due to a Continuous Charge Distribution 

If we have a continuous charge distribution instead of a set of discrete charges, we can think instead of an infinitesimal charge $\mathrm{d}q$, and sum over all of these to find the total potential due to the distribution: 

$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{1}{\r_s} \mathrm{d}q $$

If we have a volume charge distribution, $\mathrm{d}q$ can be formualated as $\rho(\r') \mathrm{d}\tau'$, where $\r'$ is [!!!!!], therefore the potential due to a volume charge distribution is given by   

$$ V(\r) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\r')}{\r_s} \mathrm{d} \tau' $$. 

This equation allows us to compute $V$ when we know $\rho$. 

<!--
This bit needs more added, including the volume charge distribution and the definitions of the notation.

## Relationship Between Electric Field and Potential

The electric field is related to the electric potential by the gradient: 

$$ \E = -\nabla V $$. 

You can see a brief proof of this on page 77 of the Griffiths. This relationship implies that the electric field points in the direction of the greatest decrease of potential.

We can use this relationship to find the electric field when we know the potential. 

## Equipotential Surfaces

Equipotential surfaces are surfaces on which the electric potential is constant. No work is required to move a charge along an equipotential surface, because work is only required to change an object's potential. Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.

## Summary
Electric potential is a crucial concept in electrostatics, simplifying the analysis of electric fields and the work done by (or on) charges. It is ~intimately related~?? to the electric field and provides a scalar measure of potential energy per unit charge. Understanding electric potential is essential for solving a wide range of problems in electrostatics.

## Practice problems

1) Consider a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius $R$ and total charge $q$. The electric field for this sphere is given by: 

$$
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
         & \mathrm{Outside \; the \; sphere \; (r > R):} \; \E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\r}  \\
         & \mathrm{Inside \; the \; sphere \; (r < R):} \; \E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{qr}{R^3} \hat{\r} \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
$$

(a) Find the potential $V(r)$ both inside and outside the sphere. 
(b) Compute the gradient of $V$ in each region, and check that it yields the correct field.
(c) Sketch $V(r)$.

2) In the worked example for Lecture 1 (see the lecture slides on Blackboard if you were not in attendance) we calculated the electric field a distance $z$ above the midpoint between two equal charges $q$ that are a distance $d$ apart. Use the solution found there to find the electric potential at a distance $z$ above the midpoint between the two charges.

3) Find the potential at distance $z$ above the midpoint of the line charge shown in the figure below. $\lambda$ is its line charge density.

**Hint:** You may be tempted to use your result from Q5 of the Lecture 1 problems, however it is easier to directly calulate the potential here, by splitting up the line into infinitesimals segments and summing over the potentials from all segments, working from the formula for potential of a point charge.
