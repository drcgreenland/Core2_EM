# Lecture 1: Electric Charges, Forces & Fields


## Electric Charges

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter.Many fundamental particles, such as electrons, have charge, but macroscopic objects or surfaces can also have a net charge due to having a distribution of charged particles on them. Charge gives rise to electric fields, and hence to the electric forces experienced between charged particles and objects.
Charge can be either a positive or negative quantity. Like charges (charges with the same sign) repel each other, and opposite charges attract.

Charge is quantized and comes in integer multiples of the elementary charge 
$ e \approx 1.602 \times 10 ^{-19}$ Coulombs. Electrons carry a charge of $-e$, and protons carry a charge of $+e$. 

Charge is also conserved - the total charge in an isolated system is conserved. The consequence of this is that charge can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transferred from one object to another.

## Some definitions and important notation

Here I will briefly explain some notation and definitions I will use in this course for setting up and solving problems involving electric charges. 

Consider the following ensemble of charges: 

![](sourcetest_definitions.png)

We define the charges $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$... $q_i$ as source charges, meaning that these are the charges that produce the electric field for the purpose of the problem. We define $Q$ as the test charge, which means it is the charge that is experiencing the effects of the electric field produced by the source charge(s).

## Electric Forces & Coulomb's Law

All charges produce electric fields, and other charges that are in the prescence of this field experience a force as a result. 

The force on a test charge $Q$, exerted by a source charge $q$, is given by Coulomb's Law, which is as follows: 
$$ F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q Q}{r^2} \hat{\r} $$
 
where:

* $\hat{\r}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the force, which points from $q$ to $Q$. 
* $r$ is the separation between $q$ and $Q$.
* $\epsilon_0$ is a physical constant known as the \bf{permittivity of free space}.  $\epsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ Fm $^{-1}$ (farads per metre). 

If $q$ and $Q$ have the same sign (like charges) the force is repulsive ($\F$ is a positive quantity); if $q$ and $Q$ have different signs, the force is attractive ($\F$ is a negative quantity).    



3. Electric Field

The vector electric field, $\mathbf{E}$, at a particular point in space,
associated with a collection of charges, is defined in terms of the
force, $\mathbf{F}$, exerted on a positive test charge, $q_0$, at that point
$E = F/q_0$.

$\mathbf{E}$ has units of Vm$^{-1}$ or NC$^{-1}$. The electric field is normally
represented by field lines that indicate what a positive test charge
will do. The arrows indicate the direction of the field and the density
of lines indicates the strength of the field at a point. The diagram
shows the electric field lines for two positive point charges of the
same magnitude.

Note that the field lines are symmetric as they leave the charges. They
do not cross.

The electric field $\mathbf{\mathrm{𝐸}}$ is a vector field that represents the force experienced by a positive test charge placed at a point in space:

$$ \E = \frac{\F}{Q} $$

\noindent which can be rearranged to the more familiar form $\F = q \E$.

5. Electric Field Lines
Electric field lines provide a visual representation of electric fields. Key properties include:

Lines begin on positive charges and end on negative charges.
The number of lines is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
Lines never intersect.
The density of lines indicates the field's strength.

9. Electric Potential
The electric potential 
𝑉
V at a point is the work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to that point:

## Superposition Principle
The principle of superposition states that "the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others". This means that the total force on a test charge can be computed by calculating the force on the charge due to each source charge separately, then adding up the contributions, as follows: 

$$ \F_{tot} = \sum_i \F_i $$

The same applies to the electric field, which can be calculated for any given point in space as a sum of the electric field at that point from all the source charges: 
$$ \E_{tot} = \sum_i \E_i $$ 


11. Summary
Electric charges create electric fields, which exert forces on other charges. Coulomb's Law describes the force between point charges, while Gauss's Law relates the electric field to the distribution of charge. The electric potential provides a scalar measure of the potential energy per unit charge in an electric field. Understanding these concepts is crucial for studying electrostatics and its applications.

## A bit about vector fields

### What is a field?

*Recommended reading:* 

A field is a region of space, where property of that space is
characterized by either a number (a scalar field) or by three numbers (a
vector field).

The concept of a field circumvents the problem of action at a distance
where one inanimate object is "aware\" that another has arrived.

<!-- ::: -->



We understand that the first body sets up a field and the second body
interacts with the first via this field. There is no need for action at
a distance because the field of the 1st object is present in space
whether or not the second object is there.



### Charges

Why does object 1 set up a field? Fields arise when objects have charge.
Electric charges cause electromagnetic fields, but other fields arise
from different types of charge for example gravitational fields arise
from mass. (And the strong field that is responsible for holding quarks
inside protons and neutrons arises from the colour charge -- see Inside
The Atom.)

There are two types of **electric charge**, $+$ and $-$. "Like\" charges
repel, while "unlike\" charges attract. Electric charge is quantized:
the **elementary charge** is $1.6021773 \times 10^{-19}$ C and is the
charge on the electron and the proton. Charges measured in laboratories
are always multiples of this but the quarks inside protons and neutrons
and other hadrons have charges that fractions of this elementary charge.
Charge is conserved in all interactions we have observed. Most everyday
objects are electrically neutral with the number of protons and
electrons balanced, which hides the fact that they contain enormous
amounts of $+$ and $-$ charge. Things that we would describe as "charged
objects\", have a small imbalance in charge.

**Gravitational charge:** there is one type of gravitational charge,
which is mass/energy. Gravitational charges attract. We don't know about
quantization of mass. (You can probably spend many hours on the internet
reading different opinions on this). Mass/Energy is conserved and all
everyday objects are gravitationally charged so they all attract each
other but gravity is very weak -- we can easily pick up bits of paper
with an electrically charged rod when rather few electrons have been
moved.

**Strong field charge:** there are three types of fundamental strong
charge (red, green and blue) + three anticharges. Charges attract.
Colour is quantised and colour is conserved in interactions. All
everyday objects are colour neutral. Colour fields are confined within
subatomic particles i.e. to length scales of $\sim 10^{-15}$ m.

## Scalar and vector fields

A scalar field is characterized at each point by a single number. e.g.
the temperature, $T$, at each position in a block of metal heated at
some places and cooled at others.

$T$ is a function of position i.e. $T = T(x,y,z)$. At every point we can
measure the scalar value of the temperature $T$. The black lines
represent isotherms i.e. lines where the temperature is constant
($T_1 < T_2 < T_3 < T_4 < T_5$). Heat flow (blue arrows) is
perpendicular to the contours of constant temperature - the isotherms
($T_1$, $T_2$ etc). The magnitude of the heat flow is proportional to
the temperature gradient so that the heat flow is larger when isotherms
are closer together.

The scalar temperature field has an associated vector field because at
any point, the heat flow is a vector, the **magnitude** and
**direction** of which depend on position. Heat flow is therefore a
vector field which is related to the scalar field of temperature. The
vector gradient of the field of heat flow depends on the temperature at
each point.

## Link between scalar and vector field

*Recommended reading:* Tipler & Mosca 23-3.

For the scalar temperature field $T(x,y,z)$ the vector describing the
direction and the magnitude of the maximum temperature gradient is:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:tempGrad)
 \text{Grad} \; T = \nabla T = \frac{\partial T} {\partial x} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{k}}
\end{equation}

The heat flow is a vector given by $\mathbf{Q} = -k \nabla T$; the minus sign is
because heat flows from high temperature to low temperature.

In general, for a scalar potential
$-\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi} {\partial x} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{k}}$
describes the magnitude and direction of the physical effects of the
potential, with an appropriate constant if needed. In the case of the
electric field if the electric potential is $V$ then the vector field
$\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$.

As an example, the gravitational field can be obtained from the
gravitational potential. The scalar gravitational potential energy is
given by $U = mgz$ near the Earth's surface, where $z$ is the height.
The gravitational potential is $U/m = gz$. The gravitational field is
$-\nabla(gz)=-g \hat{\mathbf{k}}$.

### Other operations on vectors

The vector operator $\nabla$ behaves as a vector. We have looked at grad
$\nabla\phi$ where $\phi$ is a scalar field. In Maxwell's equations,
which you cover next year, you will also meet $\nabla$ operating on the
electric field $\mathbf{E}$:

$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}$ (div or divergence)

$\nabla \times \mathbf{E}$ (curl or rotation)

Maxwell's equations are one of the great achievements of 19th century
Physics. They link the phenomena of electricity and magnetism and can be
used to derive an expression for the speed of light. Einstein said that
the theory of Relativity was rooted in Maxwell's equations. The
equations in their differential form are shown below and we will meet
most of the concepts in this course and integral versions of some of the
laws. You can read more about Maxwell's Equations in Chapter 30 of
Tipler and Mosca.

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell1)
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell2)
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell3)
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell4)
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{j}}{c^2 \epsilon_0} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
