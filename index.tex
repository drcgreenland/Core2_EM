Fields}\label{lecture-1-electric-charges-forces-fields}

\section{Electric Charges}\label{electric-charges}

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter.Many fundamental
particles, such as electrons, have charge, but macroscopic objects or
surfaces can also have a net charge due to having a distribution of
charged particles on them. Charge gives rise to electric fields, and
hence to the electric forces experienced between charged particles and
objects. Charge can be either a positive or negative quantity. Like
charges (charges with the same sign) repel each other, and opposite
charges attract.

Charge is quantized and comes in integer multiples of the elementary
charge \$ e \approx 1.602 \times 10 \^{}\{-19\}\$ Coulombs. Electrons
carry a charge of \(-e\), and protons carry a charge of \(+e\).

Charge is also conserved - the total charge in an isolated system is
conserved. The consequence of this is that charge can neither be created
nor destroyed but can only be transferred from one object to another.

\section{Some definitions and important
notation}\label{some-definitions-and-important-notation}

Here I will briefly explain some notation and definitions I will use in
this course for setting up and solving problems involving electric
charges.

Consider the following ensemble of charges:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{sourcetest_definitions.png}

}

\caption{Some charges.}

\end{figure}%

We define the charges \(q_1\), \(q_2\), \(q_3\)\ldots{} \(q_i\) as
source charges, meaning that these are the charges that produce the
electric field for the purpose of the problem. We define \(Q\) as the
test charge, which means it is the charge that is experiencing the
effects of the electric field produced by the source charge(s). Of
course, any charge can be a source or a test charge, there is no
fundamental difference between them. ``Source'' and ``test'' are simply
names that we give charges when setting up a problem, so that we can
more easily define and solve the problem.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Figures/axes_r_definitions.png}

}

\caption{Some charges, overlaid with axes showing the definition of
\(r\), the separation between the source and test charges.}

\end{figure}%

\section{Electric Forces \& Coulomb's
Law}\label{electric-forces-coulombs-law}

All charges produce electric fields, and other charges that are in the
prescence of this field experience a force as a result.

The force on a test charge \(Q\), exerted by a source charge \(q\), is
given by Coulomb's Law, which is as follows:
\[ F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q Q}{r^2} \hat{\mathrm{\mathbf{r}}} \]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\hat{\mathrm{\mathbf{r}}}\) is the unit vector in the direction of
  the force, which points from \(q\) to \(Q\).
\item
  \(r\) is the separation between \(q\) and \(Q\).
\item
  \(\epsilon_0\) is a physical constant known as the
  \bf{permittivity of free space}.  $\epsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ Fm $^{-1}$ (farads per metre). 
\end{itemize}

If \(q\) and \(Q\) have the same sign (like charges) the force is
repulsive (\(\mathrm{\mathbf{F}}\) is a positive quantity); if \(q\) and
\(Q\) have different signs, the force is attractive
(\(\mathrm{\mathbf{F}}\) is a negative quantity).

\section{Electric Field}\label{electric-field}

The vector electric field, \(\mathbf{E}\), at a particular point in
space, associated with a collection of charges, is defined in terms of
the force, \(\mathbf{F}\), exerted on a positive test charge, \(q_0\),
at that point \(E = F/q_0\).

\(\mathbf{E}\) has units of Vm\(^{-1}\) or NC\(^{-1}\). The electric
field is normally represented by field lines that indicate what a
positive test charge will do. The arrows indicate the direction of the
field and the density of lines indicates the strength of the field at a
point. The diagram shows the electric field lines for two positive point
charges of the same magnitude.

Note that the field lines are symmetric as they leave the charges. They
do not cross.

The electric field \(\mathbf{\mathrm{𝐸}}\) is a vector field that
represents the force per unit charge experienced by a positive test
charge placed at a point in space:

\[ \mathrm{\mathbf{E}}= \frac{\mathrm{\mathbf{F}}}{Q} \]

\noindent which can be rearranged to the more familiar form
\(\mathrm{\mathbf{F}}= Q \mathrm{\mathbf{E}}\). \hspace{0pt}

\subsection{Electric field lines provide a visual representation of
electric fields. Key properties
include:}\label{electric-field-lines-provide-a-visual-representation-of-electric-fields.-key-properties-include}

Lines begin on positive charges and end on negative charges. The number
of lines is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Lines never
intersect. The density of lines indicates the field's strength.
\hspace{0pt} \#\# Superposition Principle The principle of superposition
states that ``the interaction between any two charges is completely
unaffected by the presence of others''. This means that the total force
on a test charge can be computed by calculating the force on the charge
due to each source charge separately, then adding up the contributions,
as follows:

\[ \mathrm{\mathbf{F}}_{tot} = \sum_i \mathrm{\mathbf{F}}_i \]

The same applies to the electric field, which can be calculated for any
given point in space as a sum of the electric field at that point from
all the source charges:
\[ \mathrm{\mathbf{E}}_{tot} = \sum_i \mathrm{\mathbf{E}}_i \]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  Summary Electric charges create electric fields, which exert forces on
  other charges. Coulomb's Law describes the force between point
  charges, while Gauss's Law relates the electric field to the
  distribution of charge. The electric potential provides a scalar
  measure of the potential energy per unit charge in an electric field.
  Understanding these concepts is crucial for studying electrostatics
  and its applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section{A bit about vector fields}\label{a-bit-about-vector-fields}

\subsection{What is a field?}\label{what-is-a-field}

\emph{Recommended reading:}

A field is a region of space, where property of that space is
characterized by either a number (a scalar field) or by three numbers (a
vector field).

The concept of a field circumvents the problem of action at a distance
where one inanimate object is ``aware" that another has arrived.

We understand that the first body sets up a field and the second body
interacts with the first via this field. There is no need for action at
a distance because the field of the 1st object is present in space
whether or not the second object is there.

\subsection{Charges}\label{charges}

Why does object 1 set up a field? Fields arise when objects have charge.
Electric charges cause electromagnetic fields, but other fields arise
from different types of charge for example gravitational fields arise
from mass. (And the strong field that is responsible for holding quarks
inside protons and neutrons arises from the colour charge -- see Inside
The Atom.)

There are two types of \textbf{electric charge}, \(+\) and \(-\).
``Like" charges repel, while''unlike" charges attract. Electric charge
is quantized: the \textbf{elementary charge} is
\(1.6021773 \times 10^{-19}\) C and is the charge on the electron and
the proton. Charges measured in laboratories are always multiples of
this but the quarks inside protons and neutrons and other hadrons have
charges that fractions of this elementary charge. Charge is conserved in
all interactions we have observed. Most everyday objects are
electrically neutral with the number of protons and electrons balanced,
which hides the fact that they contain enormous amounts of \(+\) and
\(-\) charge. Things that we would describe as ``charged objects", have
a small imbalance in charge.

\textbf{Gravitational charge:} there is one type of gravitational
charge, which is mass/energy. Gravitational charges attract. We don't
know about quantization of mass. (You can probably spend many hours on
the internet reading different opinions on this). Mass/Energy is
conserved and all everyday objects are gravitationally charged so they
all attract each other but gravity is very weak -- we can easily pick up
bits of paper with an electrically charged rod when rather few electrons
have been moved.

\textbf{Strong field charge:} there are three types of fundamental
strong charge (red, green and blue) + three anticharges. Charges
attract. Colour is quantised and colour is conserved in interactions.
All everyday objects are colour neutral. Colour fields are confined
within subatomic particles i.e.~to length scales of \(\sim 10^{-15}\) m.

\section{Scalar and vector fields}\label{scalar-and-vector-fields}

A scalar field is characterized at each point by a single number. e.g.
the temperature, \(T\), at each position in a block of metal heated at
some places and cooled at others.

::: figurehere --\textgreater{}
\includegraphics[width=80mm,height=\textheight]{Figures/isotherms.png}
:::

\(T\) is a function of position i.e.~\(T = T(x,y,z)\). At every point we
can measure the scalar value of the temperature \(T\). The black lines
represent isotherms i.e.~lines where the temperature is constant
(\(T_1 < T_2 < T_3 < T_4 < T_5\)). Heat flow (blue arrows) is
perpendicular to the contours of constant temperature - the isotherms
(\(T_1\), \(T_2\) etc). The magnitude of the heat flow is proportional
to the temperature gradient so that the heat flow is larger when
isotherms are closer together.

The scalar temperature field has an associated vector field because at
any point, the heat flow is a vector, the \textbf{magnitude} and
\textbf{direction} of which depend on position. Heat flow is therefore a
vector field which is related to the scalar field of temperature. The
vector gradient of the field of heat flow depends on the temperature at
each point.

\section{Link between scalar and vector
field}\label{link-between-scalar-and-vector-field}

\emph{Recommended reading:} Tipler \& Mosca 23-3.

For the scalar temperature field \(T(x,y,z)\) the vector describing the
direction and the magnitude of the maximum temperature gradient is:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:tempGrad)
 \text{Grad} \; T = \nabla T = \frac{\partial T} {\partial x} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{k}}
\end{equation}

The heat flow is a vector given by \(\mathbf{Q} = -k \nabla T\); the
minus sign is because heat flows from high temperature to low
temperature.

In general, for a scalar potential
\(-\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi} {\partial x} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \hat{\mathbf{k}}\)
describes the magnitude and direction of the physical effects of the
potential, with an appropriate constant if needed. In the case of the
electric field if the electric potential is \(V\) then the vector field
\(\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V\).

As an example, the gravitational field can be obtained from the
gravitational potential. The scalar gravitational potential energy is
given by \(U = mgz\) near the Earth's surface, where \(z\) is the
height. The gravitational potential is \(U/m = gz\). The gravitational
field is \(-\nabla(gz)=-g \hat{\mathbf{k}}\).

\subsection{Other operations on
vectors}\label{other-operations-on-vectors}

The vector operator \(\nabla\) behaves as a vector. We have looked at
grad \(\nabla\phi\) where \(\phi\) is a scalar field. In Maxwell's
equations, which you cover next year, you will also meet \(\nabla\)
operating on the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\):

\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\) (div or divergence)

\(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}\) (curl or rotation)

Maxwell's equations are one of the great achievements of 19th century
Physics. They link the phenomena of electricity and magnetism and can be
used to derive an expression for the speed of light. Einstein said that
the theory of Relativity was rooted in Maxwell's equations. The
equations in their differential form are shown below and we will meet
most of the concepts in this course and integral versions of some of the
laws. You can read more about Maxwell's Equations in Chapter 30 of
Tipler and Mosca.

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell1)
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell2)
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell3)
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxwell4)
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{j}}{c^2 \epsilon_0} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
